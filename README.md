# Docker for [Mecodify](https://github.com/wsaqaf/mecodify)

Experimental, do not use.

When using this image, `configurations.php` will probably have to be mapped
into the container at `var/www/html`, as per the [mecodify installation
instructions](https://github.com/wsaqaf/mecodify/blob/master/install.md).
